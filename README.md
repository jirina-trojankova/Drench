I have made this game in 2018 using simple javascript HTML and CSS. Hope you enjoy playing as much as I enjoyed writting.

How to play it: try to make all the board one color by clicking on the squares in the row below. Beware, this is Beta version! At the moment it drenches just from left to right. I'm working on it:)
